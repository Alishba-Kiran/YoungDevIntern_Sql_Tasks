**In the first week of my internship at YoungDev Intern, I focused on basic SQL tasks, including:**

_1. Database Setup: Created a database and tables to store data._
_2. Basic SQL Queries: Executed simple queries to retrieve and manipulate data._
_3. Data Filtering: Used filtering techniques to display specific information._
_This week helped me build a strong foundation in SQL and understand the essentials of database management._
